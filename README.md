This is the project 1 exercise from "exploratory data" course of coursera.


The  programmer it's Spanish , so the PNG are on Spanish (week days names). The code should show it on the language of the programmer. I just let them into default.



The OS it's windows 7. (Be careful with the file path symbols if you are using another OS)

The working directory it's C:/COSAS MIAS/Programacion R . The original data are  into the directory C:/COSAS MIAS/Programacion R/exploratory data analysis . 

The codes plot  graphics into a PNG files.
  
All the codes includes an optional part to additionally plot the graphics into the screen. It's marked and you can remove it if you want.
